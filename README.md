> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This Library is still a Work In Progress üöß üë∑ ‚ÄºÔ∏è

![](/media/PyImOGuizmo_Demo.gif)

### 1. Overview

PyImoGuizmo is a Python library mostly ported from the C++ [ImOGuizmo](https://github.com/fknfilewalker/imoguizmo) library. It provides an interactive orientation gizmo for the 3D Viewport  within ImGui-based applications, such as those using [imgui_bundle](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle).


Designed for **simplicity** and **ease of integration** with your ImGui-based applications, PyImoGuizmo leverages PyGLM for efficient matrix operations and transformations.


#### 1.1 Features

- Interactive orientation gizmo for 3D transformations
- Configurable colors, axis length, and other properties [üöß WiP]
- Seamless integration with ImGui in Python
- Powered by PyGLM for high-performance matrix calculations
- Supports both left-handed and right-handed coordinate systems [üöß WiP]

### 2. Installation

Currently, you can install **PyImoGuizmo** by:

* Downloading the `PyImoGuizmo.py` file directly
* Cloning this repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/tingspain/PyImOGuizmo.git
cd PyImOGuizmo
```

A PyPI release is planned once the library reaches a more stable and mature state.


### 3. Usage

Here‚Äôs a basic example of how to integrate **PyImoGuizmo** into your project:

There are currently two ways to use PyImoGuizmo:

1. `draw_gizmo_camera()` ‚Üí Requires a PyImOGuizmo Camera (or any object with the necessary attributes).
2. `draw_gizmo()` ‚Üí Requires the camera's view matrix to be passed manually.


#### 3.1 Using draw_gizmo_camera()

```Python
from imgui_bundle import imgui
import PyImOGuizmo 


# Create a Camera
viewport_camera = PyImOGuizmo.Camera( viewport_width/viewport_height, 
                                        position = (0, 1, 15), 
                                        pitch    = 0, 
                                        yaw      = -90) 

# Set Rotation Sensitivity per axis of rotation
PyImOGuizmo.config.yaw_rotation_speed   = 0.25 
PyImOGuizmo.config.pitch_rotation_speed = 0.25 


# Pass the draw list of the current window to the PyImOGuizmo
PyImOGuizmo.set_draw_list()

# Set the location of the Gizmo
PyImOGuizmo.set_rect( rect_max.x - 120, 
                      rect_min.y, 
                      80)

# Draw View Manipulator Gizmo
is_view_changed, is_gizmo_hovered, is_gizmo_dragged = PyImOGuizmo.draw_gizmo_camera(viewport_camera)


```

#### 3.2 Using draw_gizmo()
```Python
from imgui_bundle import imgui
import PyImOGuizmo 


# Create a Camera
viewport_camera = PyImOGuizmo.Camera( viewport_width/viewport_height, 
                                        position = (0, 1, 15), 
                                        pitch    = 0, 
                                        yaw      = -90) 

# Set Rotation Sensitivity per axis of rotation
PyImOGuizmo.config.yaw_rotation_speed   = 0.25 
PyImOGuizmo.config.pitch_rotation_speed = 0.25 


# Pass the draw list of the current window to the PyImOGuizmo
PyImOGuizmo.set_draw_list()

# Set the location of the Gizmo
PyImOGuizmo.set_rect( rect_max.x - 120, 
                      rect_min.y, 
                      80)

# Draw View Manipulator Gizmo
is_view_changed, new_view_matrix, is_gizmo_hovered, is_gizmo_dragged = PyImOGuizmo.draw_gizmo(viewport_camera.get_view_matrix(), viewport_camera.get_distance())

if(is_view_changed):
    
    yaw, pitch, roll  = PyImOGuizmo.compute_euler_angles_from_view_matrix(new_view_matrix)
    
    viewport_camera.yaw   = glm.degrees(yaw) 
    viewport_camera.pitch = glm.degrees(pitch)
        
    viewport_camera.update_camera_vectors()   

```


### 4. Example

The provided example app demonstrates how to use PyImoGuizmo to control the camera of a 3D viewport. Additionally, it showcases how to integrate ModernGL with imgui_bundle for real-time rendering and GUI interaction.

![Example App](media/PyImOGuizmo_Example_App.png)

#### 4.1 Dependencies

To run the example, the following dependencies are required:

- imgui_bundle ‚Äì For GUI rendering
- moderngl ‚Äì For OpenGL rendering
- pyglm ‚Äì For matrix operations and transformations

This project is managed using [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a modern Python package manager.

#### 4.2 Running the Example

Follow these steps to run the example application:

1. Clone the PyImOGuizmo repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/tingspain/PyImOGuizmo.git
cd PyImOGuizmo
```

2. Install UV (if not already installed)
```sh 
pip install uv
```

3. Navigate to the example folder
```sh
cd examples
```

4. Run the application
```sh 
uv run main.py
```

This will launch the example app, allowing you to interact with PyImoGuizmo in a 3D viewport.
